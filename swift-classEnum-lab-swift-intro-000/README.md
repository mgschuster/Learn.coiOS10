## Overview

In this lab, you'll implement a few simple classes using enums. 

## Instructions

This lab is all about classes and enums! In this lab, you'll implement a few simple classes and enums. As usual, a set of tests have been written for you. If you follow the directions in this lab correctly, the tests will pass.

Get started by opening up `ClassesNenums.xcodeproj` in Xcode. Go ahead and run the tests by **Test** from the **Product** menu, or pressing <kbd>Command</kbd>+<kbd>U</kbd>. Right now, you'll see that the tests fail, but if you finish this lab, the tests should pass.

Let's go!

**1**. First, open up `Bird.swift` in Xcode's code editor. You'll be making a lot of changes in this file.  
**2**. To complete this lab, you'll need to implement three enums. The first one should be called `Speed`. This enum is used for comparison and has _raw values_, so the raw value type of this enum should be `Int`. It should have three cases: `slow`, `medium`, and `fast`. Create this enum now, in `Bird.swift`.  
**3**. Implement a method for your `Speed` enum called `isFaster(thanSpeed:)`. This enum should take a `Speed` parameter and return `true` if the enum value that `isFaster(thanSpeed:)` is called on is faster than the parameter. For example:

```swift
let birdSpeed = Speed.fast
let dogSpeed = Speed.slow
        
birdSpeed.isFaster(thanSpeed: dogSpeed)
// returns true
```

In the case of a tie, the value that `isFaster(thanSpeed:)` is called on should be considered "faster" (i.e., the method should return `true`). Like so,

```swift
let carSpeed = Speed.medium
let boatSpeed = Speed.medium
        
carSpeed.isFaster(thanSpeed: boatSpeed)
// returns true
```
  
**4**. Next, create an enum called `Diet`. (This enum does not need to do any comparisons, so it does not need to have any raw values associated with it.) The cases for `Diet` should be `meatEater` and `vegetarian`.  
**5**. Then create an enum called `Sex`. The cases of this enum should be `male` and `female`.  
**6**. Create a new _class_ called `Trex` in `Bird.swift`.  
**7**. Add a stored property called `speed` to your `Trex` class. This property should be of type `Speed` and should initially be set to `Speed.fast`.  
**8**. Add a stored property called `diet` to your `Trex` class. This property should be of type `Diet` and should be set to `Diet.meatEater`.  
**9**. Add a property called `name` of type `String` to `Trex`.  
**10**. Add a property called `sex` of type `Sex` to `Trex`.  
**11**. Add a property called `isAlive` of type `Bool` to `Trex`. This should initially be set to `true`.  
**12**. Create an initializer for `Trex`. This initializer should take two parameters, `name` and `sex`, and assign those parameters to the corresponding properties.  
**13**. Create a method called `speak()`. This method should return the string "ROAAAWWWWRRRRR!!!!!!".  
**14**. Create a method called `isFaster(thanTrex:)`. This method should take one parameter of type `Trex` called trex. It should return `true` if the instance of `Trex` which is calling on this method is called is faster than the parameter passed in.

**15**. Create a method called `eat(otherTrex:)`. This method should take one parameter of type `Trex` called trex. If the instance of `Trex` which calls on this method is faster than the parameter that is passed in, it should "eat" the other `Trex` (by setting the other `Trex`'s `isAlive` property to `false`).  

That's it! Try running the tests again. This time, they should pass. If they don't, take a look at these directions again and make sure you implemented everything properly, and keeping hammering away until the tests _do_ pass!
