## Learning Objectives

* Complete this lab

## Directions

In this lab, you will create some classes, along with properties and methods for those classes. You will see how these classes can interact with each other to do something useful.

This lab has been written in the `Classes.playground` file that accompanies this repository. Open `Classes.playground` to get started. You will see some directions and tasks you need to complete. Areas marked `// write your code here` need to be filled in by you. Tests have been included in the form of `assert()` statements. _Do not change any of the test code!_ When you first open up the playground, it will have a number of errors, but as you work through the lab, the errors should disappear. When there are no more errors, you have successfully completed the lab.

Good luck!
